I-Introduction
==================

Flat tires are a frequent and often stressful inconvenience for drivers, especially when occurring in remote areas or during emergencies. Many people lack the mechanical knowledge or confidence to change a tire safely and correctly on their own.

This project introduces a smart assistant that uses real-time computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) to guide users through the tire-changing process. By using an egocentric (chest-mounted) camera, the system sees what the user sees, allowing it to detect tools, track task progress, and understand the user's actions in context.

The assistant provides interactive, step-by-step instructions through both visual and voice feedback, helping the user perform each action correctlyâ€”from loosening lug nuts to placing the spare tire. By combining perception and guidance, the system aims to make tire replacement accessible and safe for everyone, regardless of their prior experience.
