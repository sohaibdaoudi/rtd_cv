VII – Future Enhancements
=========================

While the current assistant system demonstrates promising results, there are several areas identified for improvement to enhance robustness, generalizability, and real-world usability.

1. Dataset Expansion and Diversity
----------------------------------
One of the main challenges we encountered is the **lack of data variability**, which increases the risk of **overfitting** and limits the model's performance in diverse environments.

- To address this, we plan to:

  - **Collect additional recordings** across different lighting, angles, and backgrounds.

  - **Explore online sources** to find more diverse examples, especially for action recognition and object detection.

2. Mobile Application Integration
---------------------------------
A major goal is to deploy the assistant as a **mobile application**, making it more accessible and practical for real-time roadside assistance.

- We aim to:

  - Optimize the models for mobile inference using frameworks like **TensorFlow Lite** or **ONNX Mobile**.

  - Integrate a clean and responsive mobile UI for user interaction and guidance.

3. Algorithmic Improvements
---------------------------
To improve speed, accuracy, and energy efficiency—especially for mobile use cases—we plan to explore alternative and more efficient methods.

- For **action recognition**, we will:

  - Investigate **3D hand-based approaches**, which can offer more lightweight and intuitive gesture recognition.

  - Experiment with real-time transformer-based models for better temporal understanding.

These improvements will help make the assistant more reliable, scalable, and deployable in real-world situations.
